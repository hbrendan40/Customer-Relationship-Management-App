Salesforce CRM for a small business owner

Why this app?

This web app is to help the small business owners keep track of their customer information and to help organize important information such as 
-appointment making
-notes
Most importantly, this is to help personalize small business owners. Every business has different needs in a CRM and the existing CRM out there doesn't always meet their demands and business model


Steps to getting a new customer into the business
FB Ad -> Lead Generations -> Custom CRM Web App (to collect all user information)



I decided to create this application because I worked for a start-up that help small businesses grow and one thing that was critical for all businesses to get more customers is to be able to communicate to our customers effectively. Because we didn't have enough team members to support, and on a budget, we had to communicate with clients' customers manually and no CRM out there could use text messaging, email, and FB messenger in one app. There had to be multiple tabs open and it was very unorganized. We have seen small salons open multiple tabs on their computer like excel, CRM, Facebook, Instagram, google voice, email, etc. Basically whoever is at the front desk is multitasking like crazy.  I've tested so many CRM out there and no CRM has been user-friendly except for Zoho. Zoho is probably the most modular CRM out there, but it can be improved.
